              Chatbots are AI-powered tools designed to simulate human-like conversations and interact with users via messaging platforms. They're programmed to understand questions, provide answers, and perform tasks. In the context of a helpdesk ticketing system, chatbots can automate various customer service tasks.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-unstyled list-check">
              <li>What it is:
              <br>A chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate human conversation and interact with users via messaging platforms. In the context of a ticketing system, these chatbots can automate tasks like answering common questions, collecting information for a ticket, and even escalating issues to human agents when necessary. 
              </li>
              <li>How it works:
              <br>
              When a customer interacts with the chatbot, it can understand their query, potentially resolve it directly, or create a ticket with the relevant details for a human agent to handle. 
              </li>
              <li>Benefits:<br>
                Improved efficiency: Chatbots can handle a large volume of customer inquiries quickly and efficiently, freeing up human agents to focus on more complex issues. 
                <br>
24/7 availability: Chatbots can provide instant support around the clock, even when human agents are unavailable. 
<br>
Personalized experience: Chatbots can learn from past interactions and provide personalized recommendations and support. 
<br>
Cost-effective: Chatbots can reduce the need for a large customer service team, lowering operational costs.
